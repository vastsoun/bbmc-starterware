bbmc-starterware
================

This is a modified version of the StarterWare SDK to support 
the development of the BBMC project and is originally provided by
Texas Instruments (TI) to support embedded development for the
AM335x series ARM SoC microprocessors. Since the BeagleBone from
BeagleBoard.org uses this series of ARM SoCs, the SDK can be used
to program the bone like any other microcontroller. 



Disclaimer
===

This SDK package is not the original StarterWare as severl drivers have
been heavily modified to support a new hardware register model by overlaying
special C structs to create the hardware interface. More documentation will be
provided in the future.
